# Business rules governing ACA SHOP BenefitApplication and associated work flow processes.
# BenefitApplication business rules are checked at two separate steps during the enrollment process:
#
# 1) Application is submitted: are application criteria satisfied to proceed with open enrollment?
# 2) Open enrollment ends: are enrollment criteria satisfied to proceed with benefit coverage?
#
# Note about difference between business and data integrity rules:
#
# Business rules and policies managed by the Exchange Administrator belong here, in the domain logic
# tier of the application. Under special circumstances, these business rules may be applied differently
# or relaxed to handle exceptions, recover from errors, etc.
#
# In contrast, data integrity and data association rules belong in the model tier of the application.
# Those rules are necessary to ensure proper system function and are thus inviolable.  If you encounter
# data model validation or verification errors during development, it likely indicates that you are
# violating a design rule and should seek advice on proper approch to perform the necessary activity.
