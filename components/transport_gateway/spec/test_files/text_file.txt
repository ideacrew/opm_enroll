Since approximately 5:31 PM ET on Wednesday, 6/14/2017, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) verification services have been experiencing intermittent interruptions due to an unplanned disruption in the CMS/VA service interface.

In accordance with 45 CFR 155.315(f)(6), in this situation the Marketplace must accept an applicantâ€™s attestation regarding his or her access to health coverage through the VA to determine eligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions.

CMS and VA support teams are working diligently on the resolution and will notify you when the VA verification services are once again fully available.

Thank you for your patience.
