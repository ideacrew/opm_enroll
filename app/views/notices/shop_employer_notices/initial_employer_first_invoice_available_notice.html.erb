            Once this first premium payment is received, your enrollments will be transmitted to the insurance companies to complete processing and setup of your group and each employee’s enrollments. The insurance companies mail member ID cards to each enrolled employee’s home address on or around the coverage effective date.<br></br>
            Once your coverage takes effect, you will receive regular monthly invoices from <%= Settings.site.short_name %> through the mail that include each employee’s enrollment, their premium, and the employer/employee cost breakdown. The invoices will also be available electronically in the employer account. All premium payments will be made directly to <%= Settings.site.short_name %> either online, by phone, or by mail.
