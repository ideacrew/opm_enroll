Many small businesses that have purchased coverage through DC Health Link saved on premiums and were able to offer their employees a choice of plans. In fact, our current customers include the DC Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Washington Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington – all saved on premiums and improved coverage offered to their employees when they purchased through DC Health Link."} %>
