     At the beginning of Open Enrollment, #{Settings.site.short_name} will send an email to your eligible employees to announce the beginning of their Open Enrollment Period and provide them with instructions on how to create a #{Settings.site.short_name} account and log in, review their plan options, and enroll into coverage.
