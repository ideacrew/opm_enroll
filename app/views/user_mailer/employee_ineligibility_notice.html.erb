  <h3><u>OPM SHOP Employee Appeal Rights</u></h3>
  If you do not agree with our decision about whether or not you are an eligible employee, you have a right to appeal our decision and receive a Fair Hearing.  Employees have the right to appeal a denial of eligibility, the failure of DC Health Benefit Exchange (HBX) to provide a timely eligibility determination, or the failure of the DC HBX to provide a timely notice of an eligibility determination.
  <br></br>
  You have 90 days from the date of the eligibility notice to request an appeal.  If you do not appeal within 90 days, you may lose your appeal right.<br>

  <h2 style="color: #2E2E2E;">
    How to Request an Appeal
  </h2>
  You may appeal through any of the following methods:
  <table class="total_table" border="0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <ul>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h2 style="color: #2E2E2E;">
    What Happens When You Appeal
  </h2>
  Once your appeal is received, it simultaneously triggers both an informal and formal review process.<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Informal Review</i></b> - You may be contacted by a staff member within HBX to review your eligibility and enrollment history with the intent of exploring whether your appeal can be resolved short of a formal hearing.  Engaging in this informal review is optional both for you and for HBX.<br></br>
  <b><i>Formal Hearing</i></b> - You will be scheduled for a Fair Hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.  The Fair Hearing will take place at the DC Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) at 441 4th Street, NW, Suite 450-North, Washington, DC 20001. OAH will contact you and your employer and tell you when and where your Fair Hearing will take place. OAH will send you and your employer a scheduling order, including the time and date of your Fair Hearing.<br></br>
  At the Fair Hearing, you can testify, have others testify for you, and submit documents.  At the hearing, HBX representatives will also ask questions of you and other people who testify. HBX representatives will also be permitted to present witnesses and documents. You will be able to ask questions of the HBX witnesses.  After completion of the Fair Hearing, the Administrative Law Judge will make a decision in writing and sent it to you, your employer, and HBX.  The decision will also tell you what you can do if you do not agree with the decision.

  <h2 style="color: #2E2E2E;">
    Ending your Appeal Early
  </h2>
  You may withdraw your request for a Fair Hearing at any time before the Administrative Law Judge makes a final written decision. This includes before the hearing, potentially as a result of your informal resolution with HBX.  To withdraw your request for a Fair Hearing, you must  send a written withdrawal request, including your name and case number, to the Office of Administrative Hearings by e-mail (<a href="oah.filing@dc.gov">oah.filing@dc.gov</a>) or regular mail (441 4th Street NW, Suite 450-North).  Please also send a copy of this request to HBX at <a href="SHOP.Appeals@dc.gov">SHOP.Appeals@dc.gov</a>.<br></br>

  If you withdraw your request for a Fair Hearing because HBX has promised to change its decision, we will implement the new HBX decision. <b>If you stop your appeal before the agency has changed its decision, the eligibility determination will be implemented as it is written in the notice you first received before you filed your appeal.</b><br></br>
